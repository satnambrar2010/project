               Visual Studio Code is a free code editor, which runs on the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Visual studio has many extensions
and libraries that will help us learn javascript in a much better way.
Installation#
Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows.
Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). This will only take a minute.
By default, VS Code is installed under C:\users\{username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code.

                The console.log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.

Syntax:

console.log(A);

To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Cmd +Shift +J (on Windows). As an alternative, you could right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console" tab in that window.
